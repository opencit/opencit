Demonstrates the default and options elements. 
The "default" element may contain one or more selection elements. 
Selection elements inside the "default" section can be differentiated by
date using notBefore/notAfter. 
The "options" element supports only one option at this time, the "cache" option.
The "cache" element must have a "mode" attribute with a value of "on" or "off"
(these are NOT case sensitive).
Any provided options apply only to the current request and are not applicaable to 
other requests.
